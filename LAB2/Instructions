The main program is implemented in NicholeMaldonado_Lab2.py. The NicholeMaldonado_activationStack.py is necessary for the
Stack and Record objects used in the program.

For the program, a user can determine whether they want to run automated tests (enter 1), custom tests (enter 2), or exit
(enter 3).  Before the tests occur, users have the option to print each of the lists after the algorithms occured. It is
recommended that you only use this function for the custom tests or automated tests for list sizes less than 100. Printing
the lists for the other tests will result in 45 3000 element lists to be printed, for example.

It is also important to note that the program will not allow lists of length 0 to be inserted since a k element could not be
retrieved.  Only lists of integers are allowed.

When done, please select 0 to exit.
