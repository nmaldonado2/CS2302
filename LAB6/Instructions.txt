The main program is implemented in NicholeMaldonado_Lab6.py. The graph_AL.py, graph_EL.py graph_AM.py, HashTable.py, and
test_graphs.py are necessary for the program's implementaton.

For the program, the user has four options.  For the first option, users can create their own graph and insert edges, delete
edges, draw, dipslay, perform breadth first search, perform depth first search, or covnvert to other graphical implementations.

The second option allows users to find a solution for the riddle about the fow, grain, chicken, and person.

The third option allows users to run the test_graphs.py file which was provided by the instructor.

The fourth option allows users to run automated tests.  Please not that when running these tests, the option to print should
only be selected for smaller graph sizes. For example, the insert test will print the 12 different graphs constructed. Thus,
if one wants to evaluate the graphs, the menu option of 10 vertices is preferrable since the smaller graphs are more readable.

In all instances, if the graph is drawn, then it is saved as a .png file in the current directory of the where the program is
locatedprogram. The graphs that contain a valid path are save with "_path" appended to the end of the graph type.  Addtionally,
a timestamp is appeded to the end of each .png.
