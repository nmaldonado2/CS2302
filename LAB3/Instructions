The main program is implemented in NicholeMaldonado_Lab3.py. The NicholeMaldonado_SortedList.py is necessary for the
Node, SortedList, and List objects used in the program.

For the program, a user can determine whether they want to run automated tests (enter 1), custom tests (enter 2), or exit
(enter 3).  Before the tests occur, users have the option to print each of the lists after the operations on the lists
have been performed.  Please note that for the automated tests, if the user does decide to print the lists, a 100, 500, 
1000, and 2000 element linked list will be printed to the screen.

It is also important to note that for the creation of a linked linked (custom test) only lists of integers are allowed. 
Furthermore, if a user wants to test an empty list simply click enter and an empty list will be created.

When done, please select 0 to exit.
