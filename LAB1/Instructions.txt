Both Part 1's and Part 2's program must be run seperately.

In order for the program to run smoothly, the alpha_words.txt file must be in the same directory as the programs
from Part 1 and Part 2.

In the event that the words_alpha.txt file is not in the same directory as the programs, the program will prompt
you to input the directory of where the alpha_words.txt file is located. Type the directory, without the file name,
and the program will run accordingly.

For example, say the programs are in /Users/nichole_maldonado/Desktop and the words_alpha.txt file is in
/Users/nichole_maldonado/Desktop/folder, the program will prompt you update the file directory. So in this case
type in: /Users/nichole_maldonado/Desktop/folder

Additionally, for the test cases that print the number of recursive calls uncomment the following
lines to view the results:

Part 1:
  Line: 62, 63, 150, 179, 180
Part 2:
  Line: 59, 60, 167, 215, 216
  
For the test cases that print the words in the anagram set (before they are alphabatized and
before duplicates are removed for Part 1), uncomment the following lines:

Part 1:
  Line: 178
Part 2:
  Line: 214 
  
Please comment all lines back afterwards to ensure that the program runs accordingly.
